# Ravel WordPress Theme

Ravel is a responsive blog, portfolio, and professional profile theme built with the latest standards in Web design. It makes use of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>, utilizes [Schema.org](http://schema.org) microdata, and has a beautiful responsive design that looks and performs well on any device. It also integrates with the [Custom Content Portfolio](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-portfolio) plugin to allow you to show off your design, photography, and other artwork.

## Important Notes

### Portfolio menu

This menu will only work if you have the [Custom Content Portfolio](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-content-portfolio) plugin installed.  Otherwise, it won't appear at all.  It is only shown on portfolio-related pages.

### Social menu

The Social menu uses icons rather than text to display links.  You simply need to type in the correct URL of a social networking profile of your choice for your menu items.  The theme will take care of the rest.
